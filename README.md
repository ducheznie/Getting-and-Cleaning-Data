# Getting and Cleaning Data

This repository contains R script that merges the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set, 
from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, to produce averages values per user per activity for the dataset's mean and 
standard deviation features, and a new single dataset from the sets of data. Refer to the included codebook.md for 
more information.
