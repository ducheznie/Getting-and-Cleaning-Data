# Getting and Cleaning Data

This repository contains R script that merges the multiple data sets in Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set, 
from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, to extract values per user per activity for the dataset's mean and 
standard deviation features. A new single data set from the sets of data will be produced. Refer to the included codebook.md for 
more information.
